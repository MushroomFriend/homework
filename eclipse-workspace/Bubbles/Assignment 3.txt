Improve assignment 2 using array list and using only 1 loop.
+ do not need to pre-calculate number of candidates.  What if I ask to 
  find in the range of 0-27000000
+ using ArrayList to store the candidates
+ increase the size of collections as you need to.
+ Same reason as above, using multiple loops is not good
  in term of performance and time
  Use only 1 loop to solve the problem
